/**
 * Session → markdown — the ONE formatting engine (owner ruling 2026-09-27).
 *
 * The extractor's view of a teaching session and the future user-facing
 * session export share this engine: a session is rendered as clean,
 * readable markdown — speaker headers, quiz/check-in blocks, tool notes —
 * with optional message-id anchors. Since the submit-schema slim
 * (2026-09-28) propositions no longer report message ids — the extractor
 * renders anchorless and provenance is chat-level — so the anchors today
 * serve only the future user-facing export; `anchors: false` mints the
 * same document without them.
 *
 * Pure core: native messages in (LhMessage), string out. Content parity
 * with the coverage line builder (core/coverage.ts messageViewLines) is
 * deliberate — every message that produces view lines produces a markdown
 * block, in the same order — but the formats are SEPARATE by design
 * (2026-09-27): coverage fingerprints hash the line format and stay stable
 * (no mass re-extraction when presentation changes); markdown is
 * presentation. A failed tool call renders nothing (retry context, not
 * learning evidence); custom markers are invisible, same as the view.

 *  all live in the assistant's call arguments, and the model solution

 *  view seam folds cards (clean-only: a refused pose's result is errored
