/**
 * THE SETTINGS RESOLUTION LAYER (settings-storage wave, 2026-09-19): pure
 * projection of the delta record (core/settings.ts UserSettings) into
 * EffectiveSettings — every field CONCRETE, ready for consumers with no
 * delta-walking of their own.
 *
 * Resolution rule (owner decision): explicit value in the record wins;
 * absent key resolves to the compiled factory default — EXCEPT MODELS
 * (BYOK all the way down, owner 2026-09-22): no factory pins exist, so a
 * model chain that ends empty resolves to null/undefined and whatever
 * needs it refuses honestly (503 models_not_configured). This module
 * stays browser-safe/pure, so it imports config TYPES only, never the
 * runtime module (config.ts pulls node:path).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT resolved here (see settings.ts module doc):
 * - per-chat overrides: the chat record's ChatSettings applies via the
 *   conversation chain in chat-handler (chat.model → strong slot) — the
 *   conversation stays chat-controlled, never settings-record-controlled;
 * - prompt switches: passed through; effective composition lives in
 *   src/store/prompt-overrides.ts (segment list derived from source).
