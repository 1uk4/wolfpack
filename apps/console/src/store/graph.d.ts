/**
 * GraphStore — the fs JSONL adapter: the append-only ledgers at
 * config.LEDGER_FILES (contracts.ts "v1 emission").
 *   nodes.jsonl     GraphNode        — one line per node write: the FIRST
 *                                      line for an id defines it; a later
 *                                      line with a REPEATED id is a
 *                                      link-append (session phrasings join
 *                                      aliases, provenance unions); reads
 *                                      merge by id (core/graph.ts getGraph)
 *   chains.jsonl    GraphChain       — one line per chain ASSERTION (a second
 *                                      session asserting the same
 *                                      (premises, conclusion) appends
 *                                      another line; readers merge)
 *   sessions.jsonl  SessionCheckpoint— emission checkpoints (foldedAt)
 *   coverage.jsonl  CoverageEntry    — per-message extraction coverage
 *
 * CHAINS-PRIMARY (owner, 2026-09-30): there is NO edges ledger — the edge
 * view (implication nodes + untyped arrows) is derived in core/graph.ts on
 * every read and never persisted. A stale edges.jsonl left by a pre-chains
 * build is deleted once, here, at adapter load (same doctrine as the
 * events-ledger purge below).
 *
 * Plus config.SOURCES_FILE (sources.json): the imported-notes bookkeeping
 * (NOT a ledger) — one JSON map, src-id → NotesSource, read-modify-write
 * like a chat file. The format-agnostic front door (2026-09-13).
 *
 * Implements core/ports.ts GraphStore. data/graph/* is exclusively this
 * adapter's. Reads are strict against the contracts.ts shapes (the 2026-09-02
 * graph redesign): corrupt lines are skipped, never guessed at — the ledgers
 * are the source of truth and everything else is derived (core/graph.ts,
 * which takes this port as a parameter). Same idioms as src/store/chats.ts:
 * sync fs, no framework.
