/**
 * THE canonical prompt-segment discovery + override resolution (P2
 * reconciliation, 2026-09-19). The agent layer owns it because composition
 * lives here: composeInstructions (teacher-agent.ts) composes through
 * effectivePromptSegments, and the discovery reads THIS layer's own tree
 * (src/agent/prompts — base, shared/, per-agent fragments) — the exact
 * rules the pre-P2 loader used, now in one place.
 *
 * The architecture law pins the layout: the agent layer never imports the
 * store adapters, so the override-file READ lives here too (config-anchored
 * static file, same discipline as reading the source fragments); the
 * override-file CRUD (write/delete/list — the mutating store behind the
 * core port) stays in src/store/prompt-overrides.ts. Both sides share the
 * pure path grammar (src/core/prompt-segments.ts).
 *
 * SEGMENTS: the SHARED base (src/agent/system-prompt.md), then every
 * numeric-prefix *.md fragment in the agent's own directory (sorted by
 * filename), then the shared/ fragments directory (composed by BOTH
 * agents as a trailing appendix — the 2026-09-27 reorder). The segment
 * list adapts to the code: an override keyed to a segment the source no
 * longer ships stops composing automatically.
 *
 * OVERRIDES: override files mirror the source layout under
 * config.PROMPTS_OVERRIDE_DIR — "system-prompt.md" at the root,
 * "shared/<file>", "teacher/<file>" / "prober/<file>". File presence is NOT
 * the override: the settings SWITCH is (owner decision) — the user keeps
 * their file and flips back to the source default to compare.
