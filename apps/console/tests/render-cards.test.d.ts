/**
 * Render smoke tests — the lesson from the v2 bugs: protocol tests don't see
 * rendering. These render the interaction cards to static HTML and assert on
 * the output. No DOM needed (react-dom/server).
 *
 * tsx note: tsx ignores tsconfig's `jsx` field and uses the CLASSIC JSX
 * transform (React.createElement), so `React` must be a resolvable global.
 * The shim below provides it; Vite/Next use the automatic runtime and don't
 * care.
