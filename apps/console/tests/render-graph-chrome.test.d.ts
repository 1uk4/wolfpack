/**
 * Empty-graph chrome pins (empty-graph chrome wave, owner 2026-09-25):
 * Import Notes renders ALWAYS — the one action that works on an empty
 * graph, the entry point itself; search + settings render only when the
 * snapshot has nodes (dead controls are lies — the honesty principle).
 * GraphChromeRow is the pure seam (the DeleteNodeBody pattern): SSR of
 * both states pins the ruling. Fetches don't run under renderToStaticMarkup
 * (effects never fire), so these pins exercise the component directly.
