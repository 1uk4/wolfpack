/**
 * THE USER SETTINGS RECORD's shape + sanitizer (settings-storage wave,
 * 2026-09-19): one versioned, DELTA-shaped record at the data-dir seam
 * (config.SETTINGS_FILE) holding every non-secret product preference.
 *
 * DELTA SEMANTICS (owner decision, 2026-09-19): the record stores EXPLICIT
 * user choices only — ABSENT keys resolve to the factory defaults compiled
 * into this module (FACTORY_SETTINGS). MODELS are the exception (owner,
 * 2026-09-22 — BYOK all the way down): no factory pins exist, so an absent
 * model key resolves to EMPTY and the per-need gates refuse honestly. A
 * software update that ADDS a knob (new
 * tool, new role, new appearance field) therefore needs no migration: old
 * records simply lack the new keys. `version` is a PRIVATE schema counter
 * for BREAKING shape changes only (field renamed / meaning changed) —
 * unrelated to the app release version. Migrations live in the adapter
 * (src/store/settings.ts), not here.
 *
 * Sanitizer contract (mirrors render-settings.ts discipline): whatever
 * arrives from disk or the network passes through sanitizeUserSettings
 * before use — never trusted raw. Strict on known fields, PRESERVES
 * unknown keys verbatim (a newer record must never be destroyed by an
 * older app reading it). Invalid known values degrade gracefully:
 * out-of-range numbers CLAMP, wrong-typed/invalid fields DROP (resolve to
 * factory default), never throw.
 *
 * Browser-safe: pure logic + types only, no node imports. The resolved
 * (fully concrete) view lives in settings-resolution.ts.
