 * Probe-phase contracts (the probe→teach split, docs/probe-teach-split.md).

 * The prober concludes its phase with `probe_done` — a server-side tool
 * whose INPUT is the learner assessment (authored by the model, streamed to
 * the learner live, durable in the transcript by the tool result itself).
 * The first `probe_done` in the transcript is the probe→planning seam: the
 * teacher agent is constructed from that point on, and the tool's execute
 * queues the handoff steer through the wake pipeline so the teacher starts
 * immediately after the prober's turn ends (auto-wake, user-decided).
 *
 * Assessment shape (v1 — refine later): the probe was a binary search per
 * dependency strand; the assessment formalizes exactly that. A list of the
 * strands the lesson will depend on, each with a free-form read of where
 * the learner's edge sits.
