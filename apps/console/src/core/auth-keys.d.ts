/**
 * The curated auth-key catalog + shape rules (auth-keys wave, 2026-09-19).
 * PURE, browser-safe — no fs, no env. The catalog drives the auth page's
 * key list (label, description, where-to-get docs link) and the write-side
 * shape validation (owner decision: SHAPE-ONLY validation, no live pings —
 * a revoked key looks fine until a real call fails; that trade was chosen
 * over phoning providers).
 *
 * The store itself is the long-standing flat {VAR: value} auth.json map
 * (see config.AUTH_FILE): keys are identified BY their environment-variable
 * name — the same name consumers read today (OPENROUTER_API_KEY, …), so the
 * catalog id IS the file key and the env var, one name everywhere.
 *
 * Unknown vars found in the file (outside the catalog) are PRESERVED
 * verbatim and surfaced as generic entries — forward-compat for future
 * entries (e.g. a plans-login token) without a schema change — but they
 * are not hand-writable through the curated API (only the catalog's keys
 * have shapes worth checking and docs worth showing).
